# PDAC
PDAC Task being solved with php



Please Note - working time: approximatly 6-8 hours. 3 session of around 2 - 3 hours each.
I did notice i have no case for vertical lines being created by the coordinates. Other than that - everything seems to be ok.
I did not use any outside library to perform the calculations.
I did use the help of Wikipedia and Stackoverflow for the two harder questions - is the point inside the polygon and the distance between the point and the
polygon that is created by the kml file coordinates.
